Location is a point in space.
If location changes, the *derivative* tells us how fast that change occurs.
That's velocity.
The velocity can change, either increasing or decreasing.
The derivative of velocity is acceleration.

What if acceleration changes?
Apparently the change in the rate of acceleration is called *jerk*.
I was a physics major as an undergraduate, and do not remember ever hearing this term.
The derivative of acceleration is jerk.
