Location is a point in space.
If location changes, the *derivative* tells us how fast that change occurs.
That's velocity.
The velocity can change, either increasing or decreasing.
The derivative of velocity is acceleration.

What if acceleration changes?
Apparently the change in the rate of acceleration is called *jerk*.
I was a physics major as an undergraduate, and do not remember ever hearing this term.
The derivative of acceleration is jerk.

What is "progress?"
First of all, it's a biased word: it assumes there is a desirable direction, the same as entropy implies "time's arrow."
It compares the past and future and decides, somehow, that the future has gotten better.
For some definition of "better."

Assume progress means "improvement in quality of life," although to take hold there must be some mechanism to distribute these improvements.
If the improvements cannot distribute, or distribute too slowly, it is a destabilizing force on the system.
There are benefits to the centralization produced by a monarchy: improved safety (at least for some people) from the organization created by a central authority.
Some people will be less likely to starve or be assaulted by marauders.
If these benefits are not eventually distributed, those who still suffer will eventually get tired of the situation and destabilize the system, which becomes corrupted.

So "progress" is not only new benefits, but also rate of distribution of those benefits.
Information seems important here: if the people in the castle are eating better than everyone else but no one else knows about it, there's no pressure to distribute the progress of better food.
